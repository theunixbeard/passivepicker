  Use roo for ruby spreadsheet manipulation (axlsx is write only, Spreadsheet is less popular than roo)
 

*********************************************
DESIGN:

speed up picking resistors and capacitors. 

for digital electronics hobbyists it is tedious choosing a specific capacitor/resistors. 
instead, just specify:
  number of units to build (once)
  a few extras of each componenet (once)

  footprint (once w/ exceptions?? Or need per item)
  voltage used, i.e. 5v or 3.3v (once w/ exceptions)

  quantity of item per unit (per item)
  value (per item)


  XXX vendor (digikey or mouser to start just show BOM for each) 


site will output a specific order w/ cheapest passives fitting the requirements. or instead of creating a web order, create an excel spreadsheet BOM for upload to those sites.

Upload eagle files, it extracts BOM --- Dad's Idea


Digikey BOM Format:
(no headers!)
Digikey PN
Quantity
